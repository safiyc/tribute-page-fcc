                    Japanese video game

                    resides in the
                    Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain
                    Bowser.

                        Super Mario Bros. was the first side-scrolling 2D platform game to feature Mario. It established
                        many core Mario gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi live in the Mushroom Kingdom, where
                        they must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser. The game consists of
                        eight worlds, each with four sub-levels, totaling 32 sub-levels altogether. Though the worlds
                        differ in themes, the fourth sub-level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight
                        against Bowser (or one of his minions disguised as him). The game is one of the best-selling video
                        games of all time.

                        Super Mario Bros. 3 is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6â€“10 levels and several bonus
                        stages displayed as locations on a mapped overworld. These locations are not necessarily in a
                        linear order, and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of
                        order. Completed levels cannot be replayed. A world's final level is a boss stage. The penultimate
                        boss stage is a side-scrolling level atop an airship ("Doom Ship") with a fight against one of
                        Bowser's seven Koopalings. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups including flight as
                        Raccoon Mario. Bowser is again the final boss.

                        Super Mario 64 was the first 3D game in the series. Each level, or course, is an enclosed
                        environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player
                        collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas. The game
                        introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. Mario must once
                        again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and
                        return them to her castle, the overworld. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now
                        being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap allowing Mario to fly; the Metal
                        Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.

                        Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of planets
                        and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial
                        object its own gravitational force, which lets the player circumnavigate rounded or irregular
                        planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one
                        independent object and fall towards another close object. Several new power-ups appear, and many of
                        these return in its sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2.

                        Mario's cap is possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he is able to use it to temporarily "capture"
                        enemies and objects and
                        utilize their powers. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of
                        objectives that can
                        be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. Super Mario Odyssey was critically acclaimed,
                        with many
                        describing it as one of the greatest games of all time.

                        Mario Party is a video game based on a board game for the Nintendo 64, and the first game of the
                        Mario Party series. Players choose one of six characters and move around the board. As they go
                        around, they collect coins and various other items that can help them or hinder others in their
                        quest to collect Stars. The game is known for pioneering an iconic and renowned sub-series of the
                        Mario franchise that has stayed to this day, and has become one of the most well-known series in
                        gaming.
